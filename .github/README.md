This module, try to create some own commands or simply modify part of the existing ones.
To request different parameters or to change their behavior.

- `itemadd`: A small modification of the additem, but that prevents you from giving the item to another person. You can only give yourself the item you choose. What we want to avoid is that you can send the backpack to another person of items or things that they do not need. Used perhaps on test servers.
